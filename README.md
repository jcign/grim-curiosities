Instructions to build Current Version of Grim Curiosities


**For Animated Scenes:**

1.) Use a movie editor (EX: Windows Movie Maker, Final Cut Pro) to sync the sound files to animation.

2.) Add voice captions at the bottom center of the video.

3.) Upload final video files to Interlude Treehouse.

4.) Connect each scene to each other (EX: Scene 1 part 1 to Scene 1 part 2 and so on).


**For Puzzle Stills:**

1.) Drag a puzzle still into a movie editor.

2.) Extend the duration of the image to 3s (for short dialogue) or 30s (Exploration parts)

**NOTE:** The Flow chart PDF in the Puzzle Stills folders tells you how many videos are needed as well as what needs to be done to each clip.

3.) Add voice captions at the bottom center of the video.

4.) Upload all of the UI and final videos to treehouse.

5.) Connect the puzzle just like in the Flow Chart PDF.

**NOTE:** Make sure that the "click node action" is set to "on click"
